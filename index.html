    <h1>The Daily Routine</h1>
    <h2>By Ardian Selmanovic</h2>
    <p>This story features a 19 year old named Ryan and his daily routine that he does almost everday. It is largely based on my personal life and what I do everyday and the feelings I have throughout the day. My goal is to entertain the viewer and show how everyday life is for a working student in NYC at that age.</p>
